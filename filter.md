# Node Filters
Using the below filter classes, you can filter the useful nodes, based on the node tags, to get the matching node subset.

## Filter Types
The generic Filters are:
- FilterAnd: node must satisfy all the child criteria to be selected 
- FilterOr: node must satisfy at least one child criteria to be selected
- FilterHead: node must be an attention head
- FilterNeuron: node must be an MLP neuron
- FilterPosition: node must be located the the specified location
- FilterContains: node tags must contain the specified text
- FilterAttention: node must attend to the specified token and (optionally) with at least the specified percentage strength 
- FilterImpact: node must impact the specified answer token(s)
- FilterAlgo: node must have the specified algorithm tag

The library can be extended with topic-additional specific filter classes

## Filter Use 
Filters are often used to find candidate nodes that _could_ implement a specific algorithmic task. 
Confirming that a node _does_ implement the algorithmic task is not covered here.

As an example, suppose we have an addition model, and want to find all "candidate" nodes that:
- Are at position P14
- Are an attention head
- Attend to (at least) D2 and D'2
- Impact (at least) answer token A3

In a Colab, we can find the candidate nodes with this filter:

````
import QuantaMechInterp as qt

my_filters = qt.FilterAnd(
    qt.FilterHead(),
    qt.FilterPosition(qt.position_name(14)),
    qt.FilterAttention(cfg.dn_to_position_name(2)), # Attends to D2
    qt.FilterAttention(cfg.ddn_to_position_name(2)), # Attends to D'2
    qt.FilterImpact(qt.answer_name(3))) # Impacts A3

test_nodes = qt.filter_nodes(cfg.useful_nodes, my_filters)
````
